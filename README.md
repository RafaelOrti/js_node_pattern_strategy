# My Strategy Pattern Project

An example of the Strategy Pattern implemented in Node.js.

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object (context) to change its behavior dynamically by selecting from a family of algorithms or strategies. It promotes the concept of "composition over inheritance" and decouples the algorithms from the context that uses them. This pattern is particularly useful when you have different algorithms or strategies that can be used interchangeably based on specific conditions or requirements.

The Strategy Pattern typically involves the following components:

1. Context: This is the object that contains a reference to the strategy object and provides an interface for clients to execute the strategy.

2. Strategy: This is the interface or base class that defines the contract for all the concrete strategies. It declares a common method that the context uses to execute the strategy.

3. Concrete Strategies: These are the different algorithm implementations that implement the Strategy interface. Each concrete strategy represents a specific algorithm or behavior.

The typical flow of the Strategy Pattern involves setting a concrete strategy on the context, and when the context needs to perform its operation, it delegates the task to the strategy that is currently set.
